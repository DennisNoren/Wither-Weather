### Getting Started

#### When the Wither Weather app opens, you see a list of cities. The idea is to select two cities for examination of their temperature patterns. You select by simply clicking on the city’s row (unselect by clicking again). Use the controls at the bottom to move to different pages. You can also search by typing text in the search box at the top (the search text applies to both city and state names). There are about 675 cities listed, all among the 48 co-terminus United States. The two most recently selected cities are the ones to be used. There are about 4600 weather stations used.  

### Getting Data Displayed

#### Then select the Temperature tab at the top, which transfers you to a different display. You can accept all default values and click the ‘Go’ button to see a result, but you will have to wait for the data to appear. This is because there are several API calls to be made to the NOAA website. The response time depends mostly on the length of the range of dates requested. The app does this processing:  
##### - Grabs the two selected cities,  
##### - Requests/receives data from nearby weather stations,
##### - Interpolates among weather stations,  
##### - Displays and labels the data for the two cities, including the “normal” range between minimum and maximum as a light blue band,  
##### - Displays the number of stations used, and if you hover the cursor over this, displays the distances to stations.

### Varying the Results

#### You can then interact with the displayed data and make new data requests. The plotted daily values will probably have a very jagged appearance, especially if you have selected multiple years, but you can use controls to change this:  
##### - Use your mouse within a plot to select a particular date, and the exact data values will appear at the top of the plot.  
##### - Drag the cursor across a range of dates in either the top or bottom plot; this will zoom in for both plots, stretching the data horizontally across the plot area. To return to the full data range, double click within either plot.  
##### - Notice the small numeric value displayed on the lower left corner of both plots. To apply a moving average, change this to a higher value and type ‘return’ to activate. This is applied immediately; a value somewhere between 5 and 20 is a reasonable choice, but feel free to experiment.  
##### - On the left panel, you can select and apply different begin and end dates, search radius, maximum number of stations to search for, and a Butterworth high pass filter. To select dates, click on the existing date and interact with the selector; double click on the year After selection, you must select the ‘Go’ button to initiate the request. Then you wait again for the requests to be made and the data to be processed.  
##### - You might want to select a higher filter frequency than the default, say 12, 13, or 14, which will smooth/generalize more. Moving the frequency below 8 might not be a useful transformation because it will accentuate the day-by-day variations. If you have selected many years of data, the high pass filter might not produce a result – it may be that no daily values are plotted.  
##### - You can continue to try new input parameter combinations on the selected cities, or return to the Cities tab to select new cities.  
##### - Select the ‘Close’ button to close the application.
